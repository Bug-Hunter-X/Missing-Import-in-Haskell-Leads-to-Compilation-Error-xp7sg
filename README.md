# Haskell Compilation Error: Missing Import

This repository demonstrates a common Haskell compilation error caused by forgetting to import necessary modules.  The `bug.hs` file contains code that attempts to use the `length` function from `Data.List` without explicitly importing it, resulting in a compilation failure.

The `bugSolution.hs` file provides the corrected code with the appropriate import statement.

This example highlights the importance of carefully managing imports in Haskell to avoid compilation errors.
